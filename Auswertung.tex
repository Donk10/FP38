\section{Abstract}
In this experiment the trace gases Nitrogendioxid ($NO_2$) and Ozone ($O_3$) are examined with DOASIS. These gases play an important role for life on earth. Therefore it is important to have a method to determine the concentration in the air. The DOASIS (DOAS Intelligent System) was developed at the Institut for Environmental physics at University Heidelberg

\section{Meassurements}
\subsection{Nitrogendioxid gas-cell}
In this part of the experiment we measured the absorption of a $NO_2$ gas-cell in the spectrum of an Hg-lamp. Due to the nature of this measurement we could simplify the problem by using the fact that we have access to $I_0$ by taking a spectrum without the gas cell in the light path and then take a measurement with the gas-cell in the light path to measure $I$. After dark current and offset were corrected for both measurements we used the simplified lambert-beer law to get to equation.
\begin{equation}
\tau = \log(\frac{I_0(\lambda)}{I_0(\lambda)})= \sigma_{NO_2} \cdot \rho \cdot L
\end{equation}
The reference convolution for $NO_2$ was then used to compute the SCD$= \rho \cdot L$. This was then used to compute the density $\rho = (2.81 \pm 0.07 ) \cdot 10^{-7} \frac{\text{mol}}{\text{cm}^3}$ and the mixture ratio $(6.29 \pm 0.39) \cdot 10^3 \text{ppm}$.

\subsection{Sunlight of a recorded daycycle}
The DOAS least squares fit computes the SCD values for the different daytimes and traces gases, namely ozone and nitrogendioxid. Those values were then plotted and can be seen in figures ...
